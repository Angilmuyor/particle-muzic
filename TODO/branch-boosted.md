TO DO

- Particle, ParticleDT, BasicParticle, ParticleBoosted  in sync:
  - toDictionary
  - @properties
  + all properties or only those used for graphics/sound?  gamma, E, T could be useful for o screen information  

- Node controller -> use ParticleBoosted and *kwargs
- ParticleAccumulatorNode -> use ParticleBoosted and *kwargs

- Time mapping need to be done outside the particle class
  - create mapping Class
  - import mapping class into particle
  -



- work in 3D
-



DONE
- ParticleBoosted:
  - particles can be initialized with p/E and angle
  - p/E and angles of decayed particles are calculated

- particletools: the module from pip is used
