TO DO

Python:
- Prepare classes for 2-body decay vs. 3-body decay and n-body
- Implement 3-body decay
- Implement 4-body decay (1 to 2x2, (1 to 2)x2)
- Time mapping need to be done outside the particle class
  - create mapping Class
  - import mapping class into particle

- Particle lists in triggers need to be updated to the name of particles in particleTools

- A triggering method for OSC from mobile phone would be helpful


Java:
- Generalize code to accept different visualizations
- Implement Bubble chamber visualization
  - width of track
  - how particles loose energy
  -

- All visualizations should include a timer to have a sense of the time it takes for these processes

-



- work in 3D
