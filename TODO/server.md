### General
- Stress test
- C++?

### Particle Class in Python
- Particle Boosted:
  - Initialize with Energy or momentum
  - Calculate Energy/momentum of child particles
  - Calculate angle of child particles

- Check libraries:
  - ParticleDataTool upgrade to latest version
  - Why not uubar in ParticleDataTool?

- Mappings at particle class level:
  - Time mappings should be done at the node level?

### New physics processes
- Hadronization: which library can give us jets?
- Radiative processes
  - Include the probability of radiative processes:
    - server should work fine as it is
    - more physics information should be added to particle class
- Baryogenesis
  - Inverse processes: from n to 1
- Nucleog√©nesis
  - Inverse processes: from n to 1

### Nodes
- More options for mappings
- all mappings should be done at the nodes level
